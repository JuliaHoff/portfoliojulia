I’m Julia Hoff, Currently a Digital Data Strategist student at Hyper Island in Stockholm. At Hyper Island we focus a lot on working in and agile way, how to create effective teams and self development. We get real briefs for real clients.<a href="#work">Here</a> you can read more about some of the briefs I have been given since starting at Hyper Island. During my year at Hyper Island I have learned how to analyse and draw conclusions from data and how to put them into practical use in social media campaigns, improving websites, driving traffic with the help of retargeting, SEO and SEM. I have learned how to code in HTML and CSS. I’m also learning Javascript outside of school, by myself. I like coding because I get to put both my creative side and problem solving skills into practice and I love the reward when things turn out the way I intend them to, especially after some time of trial and error.<br>
<br>
As a person I'm curious, fearless and like to explore new things. I’m patient yet a little bit restless and like to make things happen. I like doing research and I love to meet new people.<br>
<br>
When I’m not analysing data or crunching code, I’m traveling as often as I have a chance. I’ve visited all continents except Antarctica, but it’s definitely on my list. And one of the things I love to do is snowboarding, so I’ve spent a lot of time searching for the best powder runs. So far Japan is number one on my list closely followed by Canada and Norway.
